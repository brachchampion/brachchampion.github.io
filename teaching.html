He really knew what he was teaching. He was easy to get ahold of for office hours and extra help in class. You could really tell he cared about his students and wanted everyone to do well in class. I liked how it seemed like he and [TA] communicated on how recitation and lecture would intertwine...he took a class that would normally be boring [and turned it] into something interesting to learn..."</i>

But taking this class with Professor Brach I have learned that anyone can do well and I feel much more confident in my ability. He was very patient and helpful with everyone and I learned so much. I especially like how much he related it to examples we will encounter in later classes. THANK YOU!!!!!!!"</i>
