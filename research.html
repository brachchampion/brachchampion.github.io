                        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract:</span> The success of large-scale family planning programs depends on potential long-term benefits for women’s health and economic empowerment. They are presumed to reduce total pregnancies and family size, which may free up women’s time and resources. However, few studies have established long-term effects on health. We investigate the highly influential Matlab Maternal Child Health / Family Planning quasi-experiment effects on lifetime fertility and multiple dimensions of health 35 years after introduction of services. For cohorts of women defined by age at program initiation, using baseline and follow-up survey data, we find the program led to fewer children but few significant effects on health or economic production with one exception: women born 1950-1961, who experienced the largest MCH/FP effects on contraception and childbearing, have significantly poorer metabolic and functional health. Despite strong arguments in favor of long-term benefits, we observe no positive effects of this family planning program on long-term health.

                        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract:</span> We estimate the effect on the social, emotional and academic development of youth who were assigned a mentor of the same race relative to those assigned a mentor of a different race. Using variation in the relative shortage of minority mentors within the universe of Big Brothers Big Sisters matches, we find that on average youth in same-race mentoring relationships had no significant improvements compared to those in cross-race matches. However, Black and Hispanic youth who were assigned a same-race mentor had slightly higher self-perceived school ability and improved attitudes concerning risky behaviors. In contrast to previous work, we find little evidence that race-matching improves grades or expectations for future educational attainment. These results imply that when minority mentors are in short supply, matching on race at the expense of another desirable trait may not lead to improved youth development.
